# WordFinder
WordFinder highlights words in a document found in preselected wordlists

WordFinder will not run correctly without word lists. The commonly used word lists are not included with this software for copyright reasons.
Word lists are comma-separated lists of words that WordFinder will search for in a document of your choice.
WordFinder can use custom defined word lists if you provide one. It has built in links to "shortlist.wl" and "longlist.wl".
Other filenames can be used too, but must be manually linked every time.
